# tabparty

Tabparty is a chrome extension that allows a user to create a room and share a link so other people can join. 
Once people are in the room they're able to see real time what the other person is doing on their tab.

This allows for teachers to share their screen without the load of a HD video stream as long as what they're doing is in the web!
This also allows for people to watch movies together.
